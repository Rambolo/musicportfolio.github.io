	<p>I am a metal-core producer who is currently in the midst of starting up my own band, 
	using my demos below as a starting point for what I want to achieve.</p>
	<p>All songs are recorded, produced, and engineered by myself. 
	Drums and synthesizers were added post-production through MIDI and mixed.</p>

        <h2>Track 1 - Blood</h2>
        <p class="description">Blood is a metal-core demo track I have completely produced and mixed 
		myself from the ground up. All guitars, bass, and vocals were recorded and engineered by me. The drums 
		were programmed in through MIDI.\n
		This track was the first track I made for my metal-core adventure, where I really 
		experimented with post-fx and automation.</p>

        <h2>Track 2 - Hollow Bodies</h2>
        <p class="description">Hollow Bodies was the 2nd installment of my metal-core 
		exploration stage, and frankly the one that I'm most proud of at the moment.</p>
		<p>This song utilizes a lower sung vocal, layered with a sung falsetto harmony overtop some
		heavy lower guitars, bass, and some punching drums.

        <h2>Track 3 - Awakened</h2>
        <p class="description">This third track is my most recent track where I started to craft
		my own guitar tones using different amp-sim plugins, and ended up making some tones that I'm really proud of.</p>
		<p>In this track, I started to really try and work on my bass tone & drum tone as well to make the
		bass poke through more in the mid-range to low-highs, instead of dominating the sub and mid-lows. And also 
		experimented on a new mixing style for my drums to finally tame the harshness of my cymbals, etc.</p>
